## Hello there 👋

My name is Ruben Luna a CS student at Texas State who treats code like art and security like a puzzle. Bilingual in English, Spanish, and C++.

I like understanding how things work—then finding where they don't.

I have experience in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and am knowledgeable in computer networks. My current certificate roadmap is CompTIA A+ --> CCNA --> CompTIA Sec+.

Full-time developer at home.

My favorite project I've got stored in my arsenal is the AIChatBot

**Fun Facts**

 - I'm a certified Scuba Diver
 - I speak 3 languages, 2 fluent.
 - I built the animated name above.
 - I consider myself to be an explorer
